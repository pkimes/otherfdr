Description: Several FDR controlling methods described in the statistical literature are not available
    as simple R packages. Occassionally, these methods are re-implemented by other researchers for the
    purpose of benchmarking. However, these implementations are often burried in GitHub repos (which aren't
    necessarily R packages) or larger packages documenting analyses. This package is a simple collection
    of these various FDR controlling methods, centralized for easier access.
